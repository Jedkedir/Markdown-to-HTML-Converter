# 📝 Markdown to HTML Converter 

The **Markdown to HTML Converter** is a command-line tool designed to take Markdown files and transform them into clean, styled HTML output, making them ready for web viewing and sharing.

## ✨ Features

- **Markdown Parsing**: Converts standard Markdown syntax into corresponding HTML elements.

- **Clean Output**: Generates structured HTML with embedded CSS for immediate, aesthetic presentation.

- **Simple Interface**: Command-line driven for easy integration into build scripts or manual use.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

To run this tool, you need Node.js installed on your system.

### Dependencies

This project relies on the following key module:

`marked`: Used for the core Markdown parsing functionality.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository (if applicable) or ensure you have the project files.

2. Install the required dependencies using npm:

`npm install marked`


## 🚀 Usage

To convert a Markdown file, run the main script (`markdown_converter.js`) followed by the path to your Markdown file.

Example

Assuming you have a Markdown file named `report.md` in the same directory:
`
node markdown_converter.js report.md
`


The script will read the content of report.md, perform the conversion, and output the generated HTML to a file (or stdout, depending on the full implementation of markdown_converter.js).

## 🔮 Next Steps

The next major planned feature for this tool is:

- Syntax Highlighting: Implementing support for syntax highlighting within code blocks to improve readability.
